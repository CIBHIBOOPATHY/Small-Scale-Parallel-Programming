# Small-Scale-Parallel-Programming
This project develops a sparse matrix-vector product kernel in C, parallelized using OpenMP and CUDA for computing y‚ÜêAx on Crescent at Cranfield University. Accuracy is verified against a serial implementation. Test matrices are sourced from the Suite Sparse Matrix Collection. Performance is analyzed and compared between OpenMP and CUDA versions.

The test matrices are sourced from the Suite Sparse Matrix Collection from the website https://sparse.tamu.edu/.
